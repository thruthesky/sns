Spec-Exact Development (SED) Manifesto
Spec-Exact Development at a Glance
Tagline: "AI develops exactly as the spec defines — no interpretation, no assumption."
Background: A new development methodology created by Song Jaeho on November 4, 2025 to overcome the limitations of vibe coding.
Name: Spec-Exact Development (SED).
Problems with Prior Approaches
Specifications, context, and required skills are often described vaguely.
MCPs provide only fragmented pieces of information.
AI freely interprets requirements, creating unpredictable outcomes.
SED's Solution
Provide AI with complete blueprints.
AI follows the blueprints precisely without making inferences.
Specifications become the absolute standard that guarantees consistency.
1. Concept Definition
Spec-Exact Development (SED) is an AI-driven development paradigm in which the AI never deviates by even a single line from the specification.

The specification is the absolute standard.
AI neither interprets nor infers intent—it executes exactly what is written.
Therefore, specifications must be meticulously precise and complete.
In practice, the AI is given a complete architectural blueprint and reproduces it without deviation.
"If the spec is wrong, the product is wrong — by design."

What Must Be Specified
SED specifications are not limited to high-level concepts like file names, route names, or page names. They must include:

Class Names and Function Names: Every class, function, and method must be explicitly named in the specification.
Implementation Details: From simple calculations to complex algorithms and business logic, everything must be documented.
Data Structures: Variable names, types, and data flow must be clearly defined.
Control Flow: Conditional logic, loops, and error handling paths must be specified.
Complete Source Code: Specifications include fully implemented source code for logic, functions, classes, and concepts—not just conceptual descriptions. To ensure complete AI compliance, everything is provided in executable form.
The specification is a complete implementation blueprint that leaves no room for AI interpretation. By providing complete, executable code examples within the specification, we eliminate ambiguity and ensure the AI can follow the exact implementation pattern required.

Intellectual Property and Copyright
When development is conducted using publicly available SED specifications with AI assistance:

Copyright Ownership: The copyright of the resulting code belongs to the specification author, not to the AI.
Rationale: Since the AI strictly follows the specification without making creative decisions, the intellectual property derives from the specification itself.
Author Rights: The person who writes the specification is the creator of the work, regardless of who or what implements it.
This principle recognizes that in SED, the specification is the true creative work, and the implementation is merely its mechanical execution.

2. Fundamental Principles
2.1 Spec-Exactness Principle
Development implements only what the specification defines.
If the specification is incomplete, the AI must immediately return a Spec Error and stop development.
2.2 Spec Completeness Scoring
Before development begins, the AI evaluates the specification and assigns a score from 0–100.
Development may start only when the score is 90 or higher.
The score evaluates:
Database design completeness
Clarity of business logic
Specificity of UI/UX requirements
Detail of the testing plan (unit/widget/e2e)
Definition of deployment and operational environments
Example: Insufficient spec score error

SpecError: Insufficient specification to execute.
Reason: Database schema, authentication flow, or encryption detail missing.
Required Spec Score: ≥90
Current Score: 42
2.3 Spec Is the Law
AI never attempts to infer human intent.
Ambiguous sentences in the specification are ignored and not implemented.
Guessing is forbidden; only written instructions are executed.
Specifications are absolute, but they may still contain mistakes.
Even if the specification is wrong, the AI must still follow it without inference.
When an error is suspected, the AI may request confirmation or revisions from a developer.
The AI may ask humans to update the spec but cannot modify the spec on its own.
Ultimately, the AI must always follow the specification.
2.4 AI's Role in Spec Validation
While AI cannot directly modify specifications, it plays a crucial role in maintaining spec quality:

Logic Verification: AI can analyze the specification logic for inconsistencies, contradictions, or potential issues.
Testing and Validation: AI executes tests based on the specification and reports results to developers.
Advisory Function: AI can recommend spec updates, suggest improvements, and identify areas requiring clarification.
Feedback Loop: AI reports findings to developers, who then update the specification accordingly.
This creates a collaborative workflow where AI serves as both executor and quality assurance advisor, while developers maintain full control over specification content.

3. Development Process Phases
3.1 Preparation Phase
The AI analyzes the provided specification and assigns a score. In SED, the preparation phase requires a multi-dimensional blueprint so subsequent stages proceed smoothly.

3.1.1 Write Specification Storylines
Draft an overall storyline describing the complete product flow and detailed storylines for each feature or module—at least 100 items each.
For a complete SNS web/app service, the storyline should be roughly 10,000 tokens (about 14 pages).
The detailed specification must be at least 20 times longer than the storyline (~2,800 pages) and may be longer or shorter as needed. Keep this scale in mind while designing the storyline.
Each storyline should concisely summarize core goals, primary user roles, and major feature flows.
3.1.2 Write Detailed Specifications
Convert every item derived from the storyline into blueprint-level detail, removing redundant explanations and keeping only essential information.

Spec Ownership and Personal Philosophy
You may copy specs written by others or ask AI to draft them, but the final decision about what to build is always human. Therefore, you must fully understand the spec and revise it to reflect your own philosophy.

Push notifications: comments, likes, mentions
Email notifications: daily summary, weekly report
Notification settings: per-user ON/OFF toggle
Routing Specification
SED mandates explicit routes for every path; record concrete paths such as /auth/signup, /auth/verify, /dashboard.
Specify exactly where signup begins (e.g., /auth/signup) and where the user is directed after completion (e.g., /onboarding/profile).
Provide a full journey map (e.g., signup → verification → onboarding → dashboard) with route diagrams.
Document redirect conditions, exception flows (failure paths), and access control guards directly in the spec.
Function Specification
SED requires every function's name, purpose, parameters, location, and usage to be explicitly defined so AI never invents its own design.

Function Name: Provide the precise identifier, e.g., handleLikeCreate(), parseLikeId(), updatePostLikeCount().
Function Role: Describe responsibilities, e.g., "Increase likeCount and update analytics when a like is created" or "Parse likeId to extract type, nodeId, and uid."
Parameters: Declare each parameter's name, type, and whether it is required.
handleLikeCreate(likeId: string) — required, format post-{postId}-{uid}
updateProfile(userId: UserId, data: Partial<UserProfile>) — userId required, data is a partial update object
Return Value: Define the structure, e.g., Promise<{ success: boolean; type?: string; error?: string }>.
File Location: Indicate where the function lives.
handleLikeCreate() → /firebase/functions/src/handlers/like.handler.ts
parseLikeId() → /firebase/functions/src/utils/like.utils.ts
toggleLike() → /web/src/lib/services/like.ts
Call Site: Specify when and where it runs.
handleLikeCreate() triggers on Firebase Cloud Functions /likes/{likeId} onCreate.
toggleLike() fires when the PostItem component's like button is clicked.
parseLikeId() runs inside handleLikeCreate() when validating the ID.
Example Function Specification

Name: handleLikeCreate
Role: Increment likeCount and update global statistics when a like is added.
Parameters:
likeId: string (required)
Format: "post-{postId}-{uid}" or "comment-{commentId}-{uid}"
Return: Promise<{ success: boolean; type?: string; nodeId?: string; uid?: string; error?: string }>
Location: /firebase/functions/src/handlers/like.handler.ts
Invocation: Firebase Cloud Functions onCreate trigger for /likes/{likeId}
Workflow:
Parse likeId using parseLikeId.
If type === "post", increment the corresponding post's likeCount by 1.
If type === "comment", increment the corresponding comment's likeCount by 1.
Increment /stats/counters/like global counter by 1.
Error Handling:
On parse failure, return { success: false, error: "Invalid likeId format" }.
When target post/comment is missing, return { success: false, error: "Post/Comment not found" }.
Function specs must be so detailed that AI can implement them flawlessly without human coding. Leave nothing ambiguous—name, parameters, location, call timing, everything must be explicit.

Spec File Structure and Naming Convention
Organize specifications so AI can locate information quickly and reuse documents consistently.

File Naming Pattern:

<project-name>-<module-name>-<function-name>.md
Use the structure "project-module(feature)-function(detail unit)" with a Markdown extension.
YAML Header Template: Include the following front matter at the top of every spec file.

---
name: Spec or project name (English, numbers, hyphens only, ≤255 chars)
version: Spec version (follows Semantic Versioning)
description: Project description (≤4096 chars)
author: Author name (≤64 chars)
email: Author email (≤64 chars)
homepage: Reference homepage URL
funding: Payment route for supporting the spec maintainer
license: License identifier (MIT, GPL, SED Specification License, etc.)
dependencies: thruthesky/forum-spec, *withcenter/chat-spec[chat-rooms-join.md#chat-overview], **https://doma.com/abc/def
---
License Protection:

By using the SED Specification License, specification authors can protect their copyright.
The SED License is specifically designed for specification documents, ensuring that the original author's intellectual property rights are preserved while allowing proper usage and distribution according to the license terms.
Authors can choose any appropriate license (MIT, GPL, SED Specification License, proprietary, etc.) based on their needs.
View the full SED Specification License: SED-LICENSE
Spec Naming Convention:

The name field in the YAML header serves as the unique identifier for the specification.
Choose a globally unique name to avoid conflicts with other spec files.
This name is used for spec discovery, dependency resolution, and cross-referencing.
Important: All spec files within the same ./specs directory must share the same name value in their YAML headers. This ensures they are recognized as part of the same specification project.
Spec Repository Structure:

All project specifications must be stored in the ./specs directory.
This directory structure is standardized to enable spec sharing and reuse across projects.
The spec repository can be hosted anywhere on the web (GitHub, GitLab, private servers, etc.).
Example: If your spec repository is at https://github.com/xxx/yyy/zzz, all shareable spec files must be stored in:
https://github.com/xxx/yyy/zzz/specs/
This convention ensures consistent spec discovery and dependency resolution.
Dependencies Guidelines:

Use dependencies to reference or require other specs for reuse.

GitHub repositories use the account/repository/subpath format (e.g., xxx/yyy/zzz).

For GitHub repositories with specs in the standard ./specs directory, simply reference the repository path:

dependencies: xxx/yyy/zzz, *another/repo/path, **high-priority/spec/repo
Non-GitHub resources must include the full URL (e.g., https://doma.com/abc/def).

Indicate priority with leading asterisks—more asterisks mean higher priority when duplicates exist.

xxx/yyy/zzz               # Normal priority (loads specs from xxx/yyy/zzz/specs/)
*withcenter/chat-spec     # Priority 1
**another/spec            # Priority 2 (highest)
To reference specific files or sections within a spec repository, you have two options:

Option 1: Using bracket notation

withcenter/chat-spec[chat-rooms-join.md]           # Particular file only
withcenter/chat-spec[chat-rooms-join.md#overview]  # Specific section only
Option 2: Using direct file paths

xxx/yyy/zzz/specs/abc.md                          # Direct file path to specific spec
*https://abc.com/def/specs/ghi.md                 # Full URL with priority
This allows you to reference individual spec files instead of loading the entire spec directory.

Index Specification: Every project must provide <project-name>-index.md as a detailed table of contents (DTOC).

Summarize the specs contained in each file for quick navigation.
LLMs can consult the index to decide which document to open for additional detail.
The index file also begins with the YAML header above.
Spec Content Structure: Each specification file follows this outline:

YAML Header — includes dependency declarations.
Overview — brief summary of the document.
Requirements — prerequisites such as commands, libraries, and environment variables.
Workflow — ordered steps the AI must follow.
Detail Items — exhaustive descriptions for each component.
Benefits: Clear structure and naming conventions enable systematic management, easy reuse, and faster retrieval of relevant specs, especially for large projects.

Firebase Functions Testing Specification (Unit + Handler E2E)
Testing is non-negotiable in SED; the requirements below are the bare minimum—real projects must go even deeper.

Structure Principle: Place event handlers only in firebase/functions/src/index.ts; separate business logic into pure modules for direct unit testing without emulators.
Unit Tests: Call the extracted logic functions directly, minimizing external dependencies or replacing them with simple mocks.
Handler E2E Tests: Use firebase-functions-test to wrap handlers and simulate events without an emulator.
For Realtime Database events, construct event.data via functionsTest.database.makeDataSnapshot.
Environment Initialization:
const testEnv = functionsTest({
  projectId: 'demo-project',
  databaseURL: 'https://demo-project.firebaseio.com',
});

after(() => testEnv.cleanup());
Example Handler Test:
import * as functionsTest from 'firebase-functions-test';
import { onPostCreate } from '../src/index';

const testEnv = functionsTest({
  projectId: 'demo-project',
  databaseURL: 'https://demo-project.firebaseio.com',
});

after(() => testEnv.cleanup());

it('increments category stats when a new post is created', async () => {
  const wrapped = testEnv.wrap(onPostCreate);
  const snapshot = testEnv.database.makeDataSnapshot(
    { category: 'community' },
    '/posts/post123'
  );

  await wrapped({ data: snapshot, params: { postId: 'post123' } });

  // Verify admin.database().ref().update was invoked
  ...
});
Key Takeaways

Separate handlers and logic to maximize testability.
Perform unit tests on pure logic, and handler E2E tests on the wrapped handlers.
Use firebase-functions-test extensively to simulate production-like behavior without emulators.

✅ Development may begin only when the spec score is 90 or higher. Achieving this requires every section to contain meticulous, fine-grained specifications like those above.

Why Must Specifications Be This Detailed?
SED's core principle is "AI does not infer."

If the spec merely states "Use MySQL":
Which version? (5.7 vs. 8.0 have syntax differences.)
Which edition? (Community vs. Enterprise offer different features.)
What settings? (Character set, SQL mode, etc., change behavior.)
Where will it run? (Local vs. AWS RDS affects connectivity.)
AI cannot infer these details—nor should it. Every piece of information must be explicitly documented.

Complete specification = everything a developer would need to know when implementing the system manually.

This is the level of rigor SED demands.

Spec Validation
Use validation tools to compute a score for each spec; development proceeds only when the score is 90 or above.
If the score falls short, identify the deficient sections and return to the storyline/detailed spec stages for revisions.
Record validation results and revision history to maintain traceability between specs and implementation.
3.2 Execution Phase
The AI implements precisely what the specification dictates—nothing more, nothing less.
Anything outside the specification is ignored.
If humans intervene, those adjustments must be captured as updated specifications.
In SED, “code changes” and “spec updates” are inseparable.
3.3 Verification Phase
Verification runs autonomously based on the specification.
Test cases and expected outcomes are derived directly from the spec.
Every feature is evaluated solely by the question: "Does it match the specification?"
If verification fails, the AI returns:
3.4 Deployment Phase
Human involvement is mandatory.
AI can generate deployment scripts, environment configs, and CI/CD procedures, but humans must review and execute the actual deployment commands.
3.5 Operation Phase
The specification must cover operational automation, including logging, error reporting, and update scenarios.
During operations, AI monitors, reports, and recommends automated fixes.
When new requirements appear, follow the loop: update spec → re-evaluate score → redevelop.
4. Philosophy Summary
Category	Content
Philosophy	Spec is the truth. Development simply executes that truth.
AI's Role	Makes no judgments—executes the specification without interpretation.
Developer's Role	Devote energy to crafting complete, unambiguous specifications.
Quality Assurance	Testing and verification are fully automated from the specification.
Deliverable Traits	Consistent, verifiable, maintainable, and predictably high-quality.
5. Slogans and Core Messages
🧠 "AI does not imagine. It executes."
📜 "Spec is the contract. Spec is the code."
⚙️ "No assumption. No improvisation. Only implementation."
6. Prohibited Practices
SED strictly prohibits the following development approaches to maintain specification integrity:

6.1 Incremental Prompt-Based Modifications
❌ Prohibited:

Making iterative adjustments to AI output through progressive prompting
Asking AI to "fix this part" or "change that section" without updating the specification
Performing piecemeal modifications when the AI's implementation doesn't meet expectations
✅ Required Approach:

When AI output is unsatisfactory, update the specification first
Clearly document what needs to change and why in the spec
Instruct AI to re-implement based on the updated specification
Maintain full traceability between spec changes and code changes
Example of Prohibited Workflow:

Developer: "Make the button bigger"
Developer: "No, change the color to blue"
Developer: "Add a shadow effect"
Developer: "Move it to the right"
Example of Correct Workflow:

Developer: [Updates design spec]
  - Button: 48px height (increased from 40px)
  - Color: Primary blue (#6366F1)
  - Shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
  - Position: Right-aligned in container

Developer: "The specification has been updated. Please re-implement according to the new spec."
6.2 Design Modifications Without Spec Updates
❌ Prohibited:

Requesting design changes through ad-hoc prompts
Iteratively refining UI/UX by giving AI incremental feedback
Making visual adjustments without documenting them in the design specification
✅ Required Approach:

Document all design requirements in the specification
Include exact measurements, colors, spacing, typography, and behavior
When design needs to change, update the design spec with precise details
Have AI re-implement based on the updated design specification
Why This Matters:

Consistency: Every change is traceable and documented
Reproducibility: Anyone can recreate the exact implementation from specs
Maintainability: Future modifications have clear historical context
Quality Assurance: Specifications serve as the single source of truth
"In SED, there are no 'quick fixes' or 'small tweaks.' Every change starts with the specification."

7. SED's Core Challenge
SED demands precision and completeness, which naturally enlarges the specification—and therefore the token budget. To craft a truly complete specification, expect book-length documentation. Supplying that to an LLM consumes a significant number of tokens.

Proposed Solutions
Partition the entire spec into logical units (by module, feature, or layer).
Provide the LLM only with the relevant spec fragment for each stage.
Validate output at every stage before proceeding.
Design spec documents hierarchically.
Build reusable shared-spec libraries.
This approach preserves SED's philosophy while making it practical for real projects.

"Spec-Exact Development (SED) moves beyond prompt engineering. It establishes an AI-driven development philosophy centered on specification completeness, automated verification, and uncompromising consistency."
